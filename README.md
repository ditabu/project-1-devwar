DEV WAR

Take a chance at battle against the Dealer in this simple renaissance themed card game called DEV WAR. Itâ€™s all about chance and being the first to win all 52 cards.

To Play
Click on the DEAL button to start the game
Click on the top of your stack of cards (the blue color) to play
Highest to lowest values are as follows: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
If you draw a higher value, then you get both cards
If you draw a lower value, then dealer gets both cards
If you draw a card of the same value as dealer, then a war is declared. 
Click the top of your card 4 times, your 4th card will determine your fate at war
If you draw a higher value, then you get all cards
If you draw a lower value, then dealer gets all cards
If you draw a card of the same value as dealer, then a war is declared again...
Keep playing until you or the dealer wins all 52 cards! 

I plan to improve the look and feel of the game, as well as the functionality. Right now, the game is very simple. In the future, there will be animations to the game such as having the card flip over to reveal its value, options for choosing card colors, battle names and some css styling to it.
